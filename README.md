# ESL Pod Client

This is a hobby project to learn some concepts and tools, including:

 - Kotlin language
 - MVP pattern with RxJava (not RxKotlin)
 - Dagger2
 
The app uses jsoup to gather the podcasts of ESL Podcast website and allowing the user to store and listen any podcast with streaming or using local storage (soon).

It uses a combination of MediaPlayer and MediaPlayback for streaming audio and DownloadManager to handle the download complexity.
